# Deep Learning Models for Sequence Generation


### Neural Machine Translation (MNT):


* Model 1: Sequence Generation using LSTM:
A neural network model to generate sequence to characters using one LSTM layer.
Based on [https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/lstm_text_generation.py](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/lstm_text_generation.py)

* Model 2 :
Seq2Seq model based on [Luong(2016)](https://github.com/lmthang/thesis)
